# #Which expression return(s) all the elements in the tuple t = (1, 2, 3)?
# t =(1,2,3)

# print(t[-len(t):-1]) #(1, 2)
# print(t[:]) #(1, 2 ,3)
# print(t[0:len(t)]) #(1, 2 ,3)

# #Which valid expression shows that a list is mutable?
# aList = [1, 2, "Ana", 3]

# print(aList[ : ])

# print(2 * aList) # Likely the correct answer

# print(aList[0] + aList[len(aList)])

# print(aList[0] = len(aList))

# Which expressions evaluate to 0?
# a = 1 + 2 * 0  - 1
# b = 5 // 2 -10 % 2 + 3
# c = -5 % 3 + 2  * 1 / (-2)

# print(a, b, c)

# Which following statements state the correct program error?
# Num50cents = dollar / 0.50 #Logic issue
# 20centsValue = num20cents * 0.20 #syntax issue, you cannot start a variable off with a number, it will be recognized as an integer.
